Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

It represents a generic video game type hero who can do pretty much anything. I couldn't think of anything more creative that incorporated everything. The hero class is able to do normal video game protagonist things, such as moving around, changing in size, picking up and dropping things, and examining items.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I didn't add new methods, but I created attributes such as size, name, energy, inventory, etc to be able to use the existing methods more meaningfully.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Experimenting worked here mostly. I would advise someone taking this course to start this assignment earlier since it is so open-ended. There are many things I could have done, but did not due to not enough time and the conclusion that I had fulfilled the base requirements.
